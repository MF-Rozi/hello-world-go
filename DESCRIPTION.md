## Detailed Description

**Learning Go through practical examples: Web APIs, database integration, concurrency, and module management**

This repository contains a collection of focused Go projects designed for learning the language through hands-on examples. It covers essential Go development patterns including REST APIs with Gin and Chi frameworks, PostgreSQL integration with type-safe queries, external API consumption, goroutines for concurrency, and Go module management with testing.

## Key Features

✅ **Six practical Go projects** covering different aspects of Go development  
✅ **Web API development** with Gin and Chi frameworks  
✅ **Database integration** using PostgreSQL and sqlc for type-safe queries  
✅ **External API consumption** with weather data and IP geolocation  
✅ **Concurrency examples** demonstrating goroutines and GOMAXPROCS  
✅ **Module management** with packages, imports, and testing  
✅ **Production-ready patterns** with environment configuration and middleware  

## Projects Overview

1. **Web-Service-Gin** - REST API using Gin framework with CRUD operations
2. **Web-Service-Chi** - REST API using Chi + PostgreSQL with sqlc code generation
3. **Weather-Api** - HTTP API that detects client IP and returns weather data
4. **Test-Connect-DBMS** - Database connection examples with environment variables
5. **Go-Routine** - Concurrency demonstrations with goroutines and scheduling
6. **Make a Module** - Go modules, packages, and testing fundamentals
